# ASCII CP437 Wave Generator

This is a simple 2D wave generator using ASCII characters from the CP437 character set. The project is designed to display a dynamic wave pattern generated using mathematical functions and ASCII art.

**Note:** The development of this project has been stopped. Feel free to explore and modify it as you wish, but there will be no future updates.

## Features

- **Simple 2D wave generation** using ASCII characters.
- **CP437 character set** used to display the wave.
- **Static design** that allows you to generate waves with minimal dependencies.

## Getting Started

To set up and run the ASCII CP437 wave generator locally, follow these steps:

### Prerequisites

- **Node.js** (v14 or higher)
- **npm** (comes with Node.js)

### Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**

   First, clone the repository to your local machine:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/ascii-cp437-wave-generator.git
   cd ascii-cp437-wave-generator
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**

   Install the required dependencies using npm:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

### Running the Server

To start the server, run the following command:

```bash
npx serve
```

This will start a local server at `http://localhost:3000` where you can view the wave generator in action.
